        <h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
        <p class="page-text">In this project, I redesigned an author’s website, improving its usability and accessibility. I began with an analysis of the original website before creating low fidelity wireframes. I then finalized these designs into high fidelity prototypes
            with a refreshed style guide using Adobe XD.
        </p>
        <p class="page-text"> After designing the new website, I then developed the website using HTML and CSS, making sure it was responsive for all screen sizes.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="section-heading">The Original Website</h2>
        <p class="page-text">I have noticed many authors who may not be a household name, but still have a large following and fanbase for their books have websites that fail to highlight their work properly. This website is one such example of a YA author who I have read
            but has a poorly designed website.

    <div class="section ">
        <h2 class="section-heading ">Usability Issues</h2>
        <p class="page-text "> Below, I have categorized the usability issues I found into problems for regular users (usability), new users (learnability), and infrequent users (memorability)
        </p>
        <h3 class="section-heading ">Regular Users</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullet-point ">Author's name/logo doesn’t link to a home page, unclear what is the “home” page
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-point ">The images are awkwardly much bigger than the text blocks, which makes regular users have to scroll more than necessary.
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-point ">On mobile, the page just scales down in width, which makes the text verge on being too small for users to easily read.
        </ul>

        <h3 class="section-heading ">New Users</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullet-point ">New users may be unable to read the headers of the navigation bar.
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-point ">The navigation items also do not look clickable due to the font.
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-point ">Because the author’s name is in the same style as the navigation items, you would imply that it would also behave as a link, but it does not.
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-point ">There are no headers or spacing for the distinct sections, which makes it hard for new users to figure out the hierarchy of the site.
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-point ">The gallery of books does not look clickable due to it's size, especailly on mobile.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="section-heading ">Infrequent Users</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullet-point ">Infrequent users may not remember what each section is for since there are no headers.

            </li>
            <li class="bullet-point ">Infrequent users may forget that the gallery of books are clickable.

            </li>
            <li class="bullet-point "> Initial news title is small and below the image, which does not well advertise events and news to readers who may be out of the loop.
            </li>

        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section ">
        <h2 class="section-heading ">Accessibility Issues</h2>
        <p class="page-text "> WAVE identified a few problems with accessibility that I listed below.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullet-point ">No language identified
            </li>

            <li class="bullet-point "> Contrast errors
            </li>

            <li class="bullet-point ">No header structures
            </li>

            <li class="bullet-point ">No page regions
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="page-text book-text "> I agree with these problems found, as the lack of identified language makes it impossible for a screen reader to read. While the contrast errors were only for the “learn more about this book” buttons and to my eye the contrast was fine, it may
            still present issues for visually impaired users. The last two issues with headers and page regions is a problem for all users, as there is no hierarchical distinction between sections as explained in my usability issues.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section ">
        <h2 class="section-heading ">Wireframing</h2>
        <p class="page-text "> After identifying these problems, I began to brainstorm a responsive design and create low fidelity wireframes for mobile, tablets, and desktop. Scroll to see all the images!
